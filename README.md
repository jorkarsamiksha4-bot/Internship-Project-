# Internship-Project-
This repository showcases my CodSoft internship projects, including a chatbot, Tic Tac Toe game, and recommendation system. Through these projects, I gained hands-on experience in Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, improving problem-solving, debugging, and real-world development skills while building user-focused, functional applications.
